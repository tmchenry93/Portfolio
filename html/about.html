					Hello! I am a Designer and a Web Developer.  I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  I received a BFA in Fine Arts, concentrating in Illustration.  Two years later, I went on to complete a Full-Stack Web Development and Coding Program.  As an Artist, my work begins with a strong conceptual foundation.  Figuring out what topics inspire the next art piece is all a part of the fun.  I ask questions like, What external or internal problems need to be resolved? Why is a particular issue important enough to address?  In order for work to speak to an audience, it needs to have a complete dialogue with the artist. This is where I found a place for web design and development.  This idea of communication resonated with me, artistically and technologically. The reality that Web Developers have to always be learning and evolving with the times keeps them on their toes.  Like the art world, there is no room to become stagnant if you want your skills to stay relevent.  As a Web Developer, I am continuously figuring out how to communicate with a client-browser, a back-end server and everything in between.  From organizing notes and cleaning up code to setting up compositions and utilizing design elements, I have found a sweet point to settle and grow for the time being.  It is a place where learning is met by a healthy amount of exploration.  This is where common ground and a love for both professions is found.
